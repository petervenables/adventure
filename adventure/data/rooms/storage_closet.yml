short_desc: "a concrete-walled room lined with shelves."
long_desc: >
  This small room is dimly lit by a single overhead light bulb. The walls are made of
  concrete, and the floor is bare concrete as well. Shelves line the walls, filled with
  various supplies and equipment. The air is musty, and the faint smell of mildew lingers.
  A heavy steel door leads to the North.
