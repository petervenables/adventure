long_desc: >
  This room is lit by a single utility lamp in the center of the ceiling.
  The walls are made of concrete, and the floor is covered with a thin layer of grime
  and water. Various control panels and levers line the walls, indicating that this
  is a control room for the sewer system. The air is damp and carries a faint smell
  of sewage. A large, heavy, steel door leads to the south, while a narrow passageway
  leads to the east.
